    # the ith element of q follows the
    # ith+offset element of q. One element
    # of s separates interwoven elements from
    # q when the function terminates, unless
    # n is specified to be something other than 1. Valid
    # values for n are strictly positive integers.  If n
    # or offset is larger than the length of s, s is unchanged.
    # If due to the offset and/or choice of n, not all elements
    # can be interwoven from q to s with interval n, interweaves
    # the last element of q that can be merged into s respecing n
    # etc and then terminates - this means that the rest of q is NOT
    # interwoven into s.
