can seem like a bad a idea to put an unknown in

- advantage of using a while loop, don't have to advance until you're/everything is ready
- you'll move something to that place if you find somethign that belongs there; if you dont' find somtehing to put there, by definition/design, it means that thing can remain where it is!  I think - run through an example!!!
